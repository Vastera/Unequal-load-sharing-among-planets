    Planetary gearboxes feature large transmission ratios within compact volumes, because they can divide the input torque load into several paths through parallel planets. Unevenly load sharing among planets lead to inefficiency and accelerating fatigue. This paper establishes a vibration signal model to describe how the uneven distribution of planet loads affects the vibration signal composition. Compared with fixed shaft bearings, planet bearings are more prone to faults due to its excessive load. We also establish a vibration signal of planet bearing faults along with the uneven distribution of planet loads. Planet bearing faults are more difficult to diagnose due to abundant modulation sidebands arising from the unequal load sharing among planets. Numerical simulation and experimental substations agrees with the proposed theoretical model.
