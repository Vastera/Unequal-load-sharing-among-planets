    Planetary gearboxes feature large transmission ratios within compact volumes because they can divide the input torque load into parallel paths formed by planets. Unevenly load sharing among planets leads to inefficiency and accelerating fatigue. This paper establishes a vibration signal model to describe how the uneven distribution of planet loads affects the vibration signal composition. The derived Fourier spectrum illustrates the contacting planet number affects the system natural vibration and spectral structure. we also discuss the influences of different planet numbers, input torques, and manufacturing error severity. Numerical simulation and experimental substations agree well with the proposed theoretical model.
