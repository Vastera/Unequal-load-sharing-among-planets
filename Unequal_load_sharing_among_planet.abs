    Planetary gearboxes feature large transmission ratios within compact volumes because they can share the input torque load by parallel paths formed by planets. Uneven load sharing among planets leads to inefficiency and accelerating fatigue. This paper establishes a vibration signal model to describe the association between the uneven distribution of planet loads and the vibration signal components. In the cases of low torques or severe errors, some planets will lose connection, leading to the shift of system natural frequency. The derived Fourier spectrum illustrates the spectral structure and the influences of different planet numbers, input torques, and manufacturing error severity. Numerical simulation and experimental substations agree well with the proposed theoretical model.
